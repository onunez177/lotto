# lotto
This is a small program written to practise Python

It performs 2 functions:
Create X lines of lotto numbers.
This will generate X lines. Each line will be 6 numbers from 1 - 49. Numbers cannot be repeated.

Tests a line of 6 numbers
This will generate a line and compare it to the users numbers. If all 6 match then the loop ends.
If no match then the count increments by 1. Once a match is found for all 6 numbers it will also
display the amount of times 3, 4 and 5 numbers were matched.
